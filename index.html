            <p>
                I'm John Miester. I'm from Manchester, Iowa. I graduated fro West Delaware High School in 2015 within the top 50 of my class.
                I was in Scouts all my life and even achieved the highest honor a Boyscout can recieve, the rank of Eagle Scout.
                I went to Grand View University in Des Moines for one year for medical research but had to withdraw from the college life because it wasn't working out for me.
                After leaving Grand View, I moved back home to Manchester where I started working part time for my local Fareway in the meat department for nearly two years. About
                four months of working at Fareway, I got a full time job working night shift at Farmtek in Dyersville building covers for farm, hoop and green house buildings.
                While working there, I volunteered to be put in charge of training our new employees until I had to withdraw from that job half way through May of 2018 so I could take a chance 
                at learning how to code.
